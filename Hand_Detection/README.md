# Hand Detection  
[HandTrackingModule.py](./HandTrackingModule.py) is a module for hand-tracking that was made using mediapipe.  
Imma use this module in future projects.

## Usage  
The module contains a dummy `main()` inside it, but a [test script](./hand_test.py) was also made. You can copy a skeleton code from the test script to further customize the hand tracking according to your wishes.

## Media  
We have a [video](./MLH_INIT_Day1_Explore_ML.mp4) that shows a demo of our _(what "our"? its "my")_ working [test script](./hand_test.py).
