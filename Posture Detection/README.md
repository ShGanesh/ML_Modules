# Posture Estimation  
[PostureModule.py](./PostureModule.py) is a module for postureestimation that was made using [mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/).  
Imma use this module in future projects.

## Usage  
The module contains a dummy `main()` inside it, but a [test script](./hand_test.py) was also made. You can copy a skeleton code from the test script to further customize the hand tracking according to your wishes.

## Input  
Test Script takes webcam input. 

## Output:
Test script outputs:
- CV2 video output with landmarks highlighted and connected.
- Rough FPS rate on the upper left-hand corner.
- Real-time location of each landmark in output.
